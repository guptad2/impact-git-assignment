# impact-git-assignment

Hi Everyone,

In order to apply for a tech-position at Impact++. You all are required to complete this small assignment which uses git.
The instructions are simple:

1) Fork the repository
2) Create your branch (checking out from master)
3) Create a file named [first-name.txt] to your branch that contains your email
5) Push your branch and create a pull request
6) Wait for approval
8) Merge your branch

This assignment lacks detailed steps on purpose since we want you to be able learn small tasks independently. If you don't understand git, here is a helpful youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9XZQO1n_7c


EDIT: You don't have to change master.txt anymore.
