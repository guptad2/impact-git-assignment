# impact-git-assignment

Hi Everyone,

In order to apply for a tech-position at Impact++. You all are required to complete this small assignment which uses git.
The instructions are simple:

1) Fork the repository
2) Create your branch (checking out from master)
3) Create a file named [first-name.txt] to your branch that contains your email
5) Push your branch and create a pull request

This assignment lacks detailed steps on purpose since we want you to be able learn small tasks independently. If you don't understand git, here is a helpful youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9XZQO1n_7c


EDIT: You don't have to change master.txt anymore. Also, if you have your pull request in, that marks the completion of the assignment
